## Climate change in the Twin Cities

We were interested in determining how climate change has affected Minnesota winters with regards to outdoor activities. These changes are acutely felt in Minnesota where winter activities (e.g., ice fishing, skiing, sledding, etc.) are an important of our culture and lifestyle. Due to these changes, these activities are at risk.

We used weather data from Kaggle that ranged from 1871 â€“ 2020. We appended the data with data through April 9, 2023 from the Minnesota Department of Resources. Data includes min/max temperature, precipitation, snow, and current snow depth for the Twin Cities area, Minnesota.
